I'm not sure what the origins of this game are, but I'm sure many different versions of it have made over the years.

The user moves the red circle with the mouse and tries to avoid the flying shapes. If the user gets hit by a shape, the game will over, the longer the user survives, the higher their score.

This project is created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The meat of the project is done in Javascript.

It uses an object oriented design, with all the shapes and their movements expressed as Javascript objects.

The actual drawing of the shapes is done using Canvas.

The movement of the shapes is done by modifying values that relate to the X, Y axis. 

The mouse movement detection, is done using a javascript event that relates to the X, Y axis.

Collision detection is also done using the X, Y axis.
